Minima Hopping Parameters
-------------------------

The minima hopping algorithm requires some input paramters. All the parameters are set to defaul but may be changed
to make the global optimization more efficient or more precise. Below you can find a list of all the input parameters
and a description of them.

    maxNumberOfMinima, 0, Maximal number of minima that will be stored in database. If the number is 0 or negative it will be considered as infinite.



Restart
~~~~~~~
The python minimahopping algorithm automatically checks if restart files are aviable. If new_start is False as set by default the minimahopping is restarting from the last accepted minimum.
If a temperature, dt or Ediff different to the initial given parameters is required these parameters can be adjusted by changing _T, _dt or _eDiff respectivly.


Enhanced Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Usually if a minimum is found more than once the temperature is increased the a fixed factor. However, there is build in mechanism
where the temperature is increased according to 

.. math:: 
   T = T * \beta_{increase} * (0.2 + ln(n_{visits}))

where n_visits is the number of times a particular minimum has already been visited. The same formula is also used as a feedback to 
increase Ediff:

.. math::
   E_{diff} = E_{diff} * \alpha_{rejected} * (0.2 + ln(n_{visits}))


Critical Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. caution::
   The paramter `minima_threshold` and the `fmax` as well as all the fingerprint paramters are crucial for
   distinguishing different minima. A tutorial how to adjust the `minima_threshold`  parameter can be adjusted to `fmax`
   can be found here (LINK TO THE TUTORIAL)



Fingerprint Adjustment
----------------------
In order to adjust the critical paramters `minima_threshold` and `fmax` as well as `energy_threshold` we strongly suggest to use the 
fingerprint adjustment tool.

.. csv-table:: Parameters Fingerprint Adjustment
   :header: Parameter, Default, Description
   :widths: 15 10 60

    fmax, 0.005, max force component for the local geometry optimization
    iteration, 100, number of md and optimizations performed
    temperature, 500, Temperature in Kelvin
    dt, 0.01, timestep for the MD
    md_min, 1, criteria to stop the MD trajectory (no. of minima)
    ns_orb, 1, number of s orbitals in the OMFP fingerprint
    np_orb, 1, number of p orbitals in the OMFP fingerprint
    width_cutoff, 3.5, width cutoff for the OMFP fingerprint
    maxnatsphere, 100, maximal number of atoms in one local atomic environment

It is important to keep the temperature, the timestep and the md_min low, so that after the optimization converges to the same minimum.
